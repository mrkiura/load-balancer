# Understanding pip install --upgrade pip

If you have some programming experience, you have probably encountered recursion. You may or may not understand it, but you have probably encountered it or heard about it. My undertanding of recursion has been like a pendulum, swinging from "Recursion is easy. I know this shit." to "Waaah! recursion? I don't get it. I don't understand it. I don't know what it is. I don't know what it does. I don't know how it works. I don't know how to use it. I don't know how to write it. I don't know how to read it. I don't know how to explain it. I don't know how to understand it. I don't. I don't..pls don't kill me, I have a family..."

If you perceive that I, Alex, is salty, you are correct. But I choose to blame Capitalism, The government, php and kikuyu women. That said, when I grow up, I'd like to be a billionaire; with many wives; some of them Kikuyu.

## Some definitions

Let's get some definitions out of the way first.

**What is python?** Python is a programming language. Programming languages make it possible to communicate human intent to computers (yes, your smartphone, smartwatch are all comptuters).

 A programming language allows us to make/ write software using special words (even english words), numbers and or characters. What is software? Software refers to a set of instructions (lines of code) that tell a computer what to do. Software is everywhere around us. Uber, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc. are all software. For instance, if you wanted to make  an androind app like Uber, you would probably use Kotlin, or Java. Every app is just lines of code, with some extra magic under the hood. Oh, and guess what, that magic is also lines of code. Hopefully, you kinda get the point.

 To create a python program, you write code in a file with a `.py` extension. E.g, `hello_world.py`. You can then run this file using the `python` command. E.g, `python hello_world.py`. This will run the code in the file and print the output to the terminal. Still with me? Good.

*The rest of the definitions are related to python.*

**What is a module**? A python module is a file with a `.py` extension. 



**What is pip?** Python has several utilities out of the box. E.g, the math
